## User Story

As a user I want to buy an accessory product for my kitchen drawer.


## Planning

```9:30 - 10:15 → 'Card sorting'

10:15 - 11:30 → ​Mid-Fidelity

12:00 → ​New concept

12:00 ~ 14:15 → ​Mid fidelity & Code (responsive) 

(13:00 → ​PIZZA TIME​)

14:30 - 16:00 → ​High fidelity & Code 

16:00 - 16:30 → ​Presentation

16:30 - 17:00 →​ Practice
```
## Navigation bar
Our navigation bar will be over 3 levels and will be mixed. The 1st and 2nd levels will be a slider and the 3rd will be a drop-down menu.

## Pages
We will try to make everything responsive, but time is not on our side, so at least we will make the Home page responsive and the other ones if we get some time.
